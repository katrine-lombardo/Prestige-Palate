-   Unit tests major progress

Team To-Dos

1. Thanksgiving work plan
2. Confirm authentication issues are resolved
3. Confirm Restaurant setup
    1. Notes from our convo:
        1. We could display only 1 pick from API and the rest from a table full of seed data
        2. We could change the API we‚Äôre using to a free one
    2. DECISION: Keep favourites tables, make separate API calls every time 3. When a user favourites a restaurant, the google place id is stored to the favourites table 4. ONLY To play with seed data, use restaurants table. Otherwise we don‚Äôt use restaurants, we just make the API calls. 5. Google_place_id -> place_id
4. Reviews and photos
5. User_icon field is in **reviews** ‚Äì Does it make sense to keep it there or move to **accounts** instead?
6. Basic frontend, colour palette, nav bar etc
7. Do we each have to write one unit test? I think we might have to‚Ä¶ Fact check please

    *   **Team and app intro**
        * **Team name**: Mambo # 5
        * **App name**: Prestige Palate
        * **Who are our customers?**
            * Elite foodies who want to explore their next global culinary adventure.
            * _We are all elite foodies üåü_
        * **What needs/desires does your application satisfy for your customers?**
            * Our users desire a new and more refined way to discover top eateries at home and abroad.
            * Our app‚Äôs users share and view trusted reviews of restaurants from other app users, reinforcing or challenging Google reviews.
            * Our app users can connect with and follow other tastemakers to expand their culinary horizons üåü
    *  **What features/functionality do you plan to have in the application that helps your customers? **
        * If a user is not logged in, they see a heatmap view of a map showing "trending" locations (ie cities where users have left a review).
        * The user sees a search field where they can make a city selection from the world, which pulls up the top 3 restaurants to visit from any searched area.
        * If the user is logged in, they will see an additional two options: 1) Leave a review for a restaurant, and 2) Save this restaurant.
        * The user's "saved" list contains the restaurants a user saves, grouped automatically by city.
        * A logged-in user can privately or publicly share a review of their foodie experiences, and publicly shared photos/reviews will be displayed on a restaurant‚Äôs detail page and their personal profile.
        * Privately posted reviews and photos are only visible in the user‚Äôs saved log, to reminisce on previous experiences.
    * @erin  Erin‚Äôs beautiful wireframe example [https://www.figma.com/proto/nlhnWwGS93gqpVt6UOtOk4/Restaurant-Review-App?type=design&node-id=7-6&t=UZRPCJuz5YF3jrsK-0&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=7%3A6](https://www.figma.com/proto/nlhnWwGS93gqpVt6UOtOk4/Restaurant-Review-App?type=design&node-id=7-6&t=UZRPCJuz5YF3jrsK-0&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=7%3A6)
    *  Tech stack
