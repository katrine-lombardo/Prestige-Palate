   <td>I like nerd stuff, and I realised the parts of my previous job that I enjoyed had to do with technology, tools, and systems. Also I got burned out from doing HR after 10 years. I need more hobbies LOL but I like hanging out with my dog and playing videogames with my husband (I play Zelda, he plays Spiderman 2).
