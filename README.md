## Intended market

We are targeting Elite foodies who want to explore their next global culinary adventure.

## Functionality

- If a user is not logged in, they see a heatmap view of a map showing "trending" locations (ie cities where users have left a review).
- The user sees a search field where they can make a city selection from the world, which pulls up the top 3 restaurants to visit from any searched area.
- If the user is logged in, they will see additional functionality: 1) Leave a review for a restaurant, 2) Save this restaurant, and 3) Follow other app users.
- The user's "Favorites" list contains the restaurants a user saves, grouped automatically by city.
- A logged-in user has access to My Reviews, where reviews and photos of their foodie experiences are displayed along with their following and followers list.
- Reviews created by users are saved to their personal profile and that restaurantâ€™s detail page.
- A logged-in user can view a dashboard of reviews from users they follow to stay up-to-date on trends.
