## Tues, Nov 14
Features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with:

-Worked with the whole team creating feature issues and journal files in gitlab

-Found a list of the top 100 restaurants in the world. Saved as a google sheet file for database seed data to populate the main page heatmap.  I searched and added the Places API IDs and the location (lat/lon) coordinates for all of them so we can bypass the Geocoder API requests.

-Grabbed a list of all the Michelin 3 stars, need to get location data for them and check the overlap with the top 100 list, maybe I can do a blend of both to save time and then make a title of the #number best restaurants around the world. 

-Need to ask/figure out how to plug the datasets into the database tables for the maps and detail page.


A reflection on any design conversations that you had:

-Discussed possibly adding a referral system to the authentication, I need to watch/read the auth Learn module

At least one ah-ha! moment:

-After finishing the coordinate data for the top 100 list, I realized I could also pull Michelin 3-star data to add more prestige content to our website.
