Features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with:
* Set up PGAdmin and worked collaboratively with the team on completing the backend database SQL schemas and queries.

A reflection on any design conversations that you had
* We are challenging each other to become crystal clear on our deliverables, and today we had to make some decisions about how to scale our project while remaining achievable within the timeframe.

At least one ah-ha! moment:
* We got to see our app live and in action with React Vite! It's always exciting to see something living that started as a conversation.

Features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with:
* We created our first 11 issues in gitlab, I wrote #11.

A reflection on any design conversations that you had
* We are still considering the best referral mechanism to allow users to invite new users to the app.

At least one ah-ha! moment:
* I learned that we can make changes to pieces of code everywhere by double-clicking a piece of code, right clicking, and selecting "make change everywhere".

Features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with:
* We successfully forked and cloned our repo.

A reflection on any design conversations that you had
* We have transitioned over to Vite from plain React.

At least one ah-ha! moment:
