Features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with:

- We created our first 11 issues in gitlab, I wrote #11.

A reflection on any design conversations that you had

- We are still considering the best referral mechanism to allow users to invite new users to the app.

At least one ah-ha! moment:

- I learned that we can make changes to pieces of code everywhere by double-clicking a piece of code, right clicking, and selecting "make change everywhere".

Features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with:

- We successfully forked and cloned our repo.

A reflection on any design conversations that you had

- We have transitioned over to Vite from plain React.

At least one ah-ha! moment:

- I didn't realise we should be working in pairs and taking turns coding/driving, this will be a new and interesting way to work.
