Features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with:
Today we all worked together to setup authentication, and we successfully migrated our tables to PG admin using migrations. Our Queries and Routers folders are set up, and we are in a good place to start adding our restaurant and reviews data.

A reflection on any design conversations that you had
Our design is beginning to feel more solid and less nebulous, which is making me feel much better about our progress.

At least one ah-ha! moment:
* We were seeing a strange error appear ("error connecting in 'pool-1': 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'encode'"). We asked for some help from a SEIR, and we weren't able to figure it out. I googled and tried debugging and came up dry, until I realised that the error was generated by accident when we overwrote the word "data" in all places in the doc, and it accidentally grabbed the word "DATA" from "DATABASE", leaving our pool connection trying to connect to "InfoBASE". The strange caps lock format first caught my attention, and finally after making that change, it all worked!

Features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with:
* Set up PGAdmin and worked collaboratively with the team on completing the backend database SQL schemas and queries.

A reflection on any design conversations that you had
* We are challenging each other to become crystal clear on our deliverables, and today we had to make some decisions about how to scale our project while remaining achievable within the timeframe.

At least one ah-ha! moment:
* We got to see our app live and in action with React Vite! It's always exciting to see something living that started as a conversation.

Features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with:
* We created our first 11 issues in gitlab, I wrote #11.

A reflection on any design conversations that you had
* We are still considering the best referral mechanism to allow users to invite new users to the app.

At least one ah-ha! moment:
* I learned that we can make changes to pieces of code everywhere by double-clicking a piece of code, right clicking, and selecting "make change everywhere".

Features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with:
* We successfully forked and cloned our repo.

A reflection on any design conversations that you had
* We have transitioned over to Vite from plain React.

At least one ah-ha! moment:
* I didn't realise we should be working in pairs and taking turns coding/driving, this will be a new and interesting way to work.
