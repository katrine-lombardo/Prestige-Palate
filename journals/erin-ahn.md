## Tues, Nov 14
Features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with:
- Worked individually on writing out 2 issues (bookmarking and editing user information).
- Database set up in the yaml file.
- pgAdmin

A reflection on any design conversations that you had
- Team continuing to discuss on sign up logic (how referrals will be completed).

At least one ah-ha! moment:
- yaml file is written like key value pairs!
