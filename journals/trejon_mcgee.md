Features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with:
- Updated the Photos Routers/Queries and tested all functions successfully. 
At least one ah-ha! moment:
- Figured out that the .env was at the root direcotry and that is why it wasn't being read properly. Copied and moved it to ghi and api level directories and that fixed the issue I had. Initially I had the .env in the docker compose yaml file to bypass the issue.
